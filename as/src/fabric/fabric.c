**                                      Fabric Theory of Operation
**                                      ==========================
**
**   Overview:
**   ---------
**
**   The fabric is a "field of force", mediated by messages carried via TCP sockets, that binds a cluster
**   together.  The fabric must first be initialized by "as_fabric_init()", which creates the module-global
**   "g_fabric_args" object containing the parameters and data structures of the fabric.  After being
**   initialized, the fabric may be started up using "as_fabric_start()", which creates the worker threads
**   to send and receive messages and the accept thread to receive incoming connections.  (There is currently
**   no means to shut the fabric down.)
**
**   Fabric Message and Event Callbacks:
**   -----------------------------------
**
**   A module may register a callback function to process incoming fabric messages of a particular type using
**   "as_fabric_register_msg_fn()".  Message types are defined in "msg.h", and message handlers are registered
**   in the individual modules.  In addition, there is support for a single fabric heartbeat event handler
**   registered via "as_fabric_register_event_fn()", which is bound to the "as_paxos_event()" function of the
**   Paxos module.
**
**   Fabric Connection Setup:
**   ------------------------
**
**   When the local node sends a fabric message to a remote node, it will first try to open a new, non-blocking
**   TCP connection to the remote node using "fabric_connect()".  The number of permissible outbound connections
**   to a particular remote node is limited to being strictly lower than "FABRIC_MAX_FDS" (currently 8.)  Thus
**   a maximum of 7 outbound socket connections (each with its own FB [see below]), will generally be created to
**   each remote node as fabric messages are sent out.  Once the maximum number of outbound sockets is reached,
**   an already-existing connection will be re-used to send the message.  In addition, there will generally be
**   7 incoming connections (each with its own FB) from each remote node, for a total of 14 open sockets between
**   each pair of fabric nodes.
**
**   When a node opens a fabric connection to a remote node, the first fabric message sent will be used to
**   identify the local node by sending its 64-bit node ID (as the value of the "FS_FIELD_NODE" field) to the
**   remote node.  Correspondingly, when a new incoming connection is received via "fabric_accept_fn()", the
**   local node will determine the remote node's ID when processing the first fabric message received from the
**   remote node in "fabric_process_read_msg()".  Once the node ID has been determined, an FNE [see below] for
**   the remote node will be looked up in the FNE hash table (or else created and added to the table if not
**   found), and it will be associated with the incoming FB.  At this point, the incoming connection is set up,
**   and forthcoming messages will be parsed and dispatched to the appropriate message type handler callback
**   function.
**
**   Detailed Method of Fabric Node Connection / Disconnection:
**   ----------------------------------------------------------
**
**   For each remote node that is newly detected (either via receipt of a heartbeat or via the "weird" way
**   of first receiving an incoming fabric message from the remote node), a "fabric_node_element" (FNE) will
**   be constructed.  All known fabric nodes have a corresponding FNE in the "g_fabric_node_element_hash".
**   When a node is found to no longer be available (i.e., upon heartbeat receipt failure, which may be due
**   either to the remote node actually shutting down or else to a (potentially temporary) network outage),
**   the FNE will be destroyed.
**
**   Each active fabric connection is represented by a "fabric_buffer" (FB), with its own socket file descriptor
**   (FD), and which will be associated with an FNE.  There are two types ("polarities") of fabric connections,
**   outbound and inbound.  Outbound connections are created using "fabric_connect()" and all torn down using
**   "fabric_disconnect()".  Inbound connections are created in "fabric_accept_fn()".  Inbound connections are
**   shut down when the node departs the fabric and the remote endpoint is closed.
**
**   The FNE destruction procedure is handled in a lazy fashion via reference counts from the associated FBs.
**   In the normal case, a socket FD will be shut down cleanly, and the local node will receive an "epoll(4)"
**   event that allows the FB containing the FD to be released.  Once all of its FBs are released, the FNE
**   itself will be released.  In the abnormal case of a (possibly temporary) one-way network failure, the
**   fabric node has to be disconnected via "fabric_disconnect()", which will trigger FB cleanup by sending
**   "DELETE_FABRIC_BUFFER" messages for each FB to the associated worker thread.  Each FNE keeps a hash
**   table of its connected outbound FBs for exactly this purpose of being able to clean up when necessary.
**
**   Threading Structure:
**   --------------------
**
**   High-performance, concurrent fabric message exchange is provided via worker threads handling a particular
**   set of FBs.  (There is currently a maximum of 6 worker threads.)  Each worker thread has a Unix-domain
**   notification ("note") socket that is used to send events to the worker thread.  The main work of receiving
**   and sending fabric messages is handled by "fabric_worker_fn()", which does an "epoll_wait()" on the "note_fd"
**   and all of the worker thread's attached FBs.  Events on the "note_fd" may be either "NEW_FABRIC_BUFFER" or
**   "DELETE_FABRIC_BUFFER", received with a parameter that is the FB containing the FD to be listened to or
**   else shutdown.  Events on the FBs FDs may be either readable, writable, or errors (which result in the
**   particular fabric connection being closed.)
**
**   Debugging Utilities:
**   --------------------
**
**   The state of the fabric (all FNEs and FBs) can be logged using the "dump-fabric:" Info command.
